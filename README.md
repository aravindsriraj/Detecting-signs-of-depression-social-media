# Problem Statement
Depression is a common mental illness that involves sadness and lack of interest in all day-to-day activities. Detecting depression is important since it has to be observed and treated at an early stage to avoid severe consequences.The goal of the project is to detect the signs of depression of a person from their social media postings wherein people share their feelings and emotions.  Given social media postings in English, the system will classify the signs of depression into three labels namely “not depressed”, “moderately depressed”, and “severely depressed”.
